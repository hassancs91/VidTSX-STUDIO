## Completed phases

### v1.0.0 — First public release (2026-07-29)
**Status: COMPLETE**

Public scope: TSX Creator, Image Studio, Transcribe, Assets, render queue,
and AI Models (System / Providers / Audio-whisper / Image). Everything else
stays visible as "Coming soon" in production and fully enabled in dev.

- [x] Image Studio local models: `LocalSdImageProvider` bridges the sd-cli
  engine into the cloud ImageEngine (provider id `local`, auto-offered when
  ≥1 ready on-device model). Promise-based `enqueueAwait` on the local
  engine; shared generation preflight (`applySdGenerationPreflight`);
  provider switch persists. Verified end-to-end via CDP (bk-sdm-tiny 256²).
- [x] Coming-soon gating (prod only): AI Models Video/LLMs/Embeddings tabs
  (`ai-video-models` / `ai-llm-models` / `ai-embedding-models` flags; 3D was
  already a placeholder), Flows editor (`flows-editor` flag — nav stays),
  sherpa voice-engine section of the Audio tab (existing `audio-engine`
  flag). Creator's keyless "Local Models" preset is gated on real
  `llmLocalEngine.isAvailable()` because production builds exclude
  node-llama-cpp.
- [x] Repo made public-ready: README.md written, personal scratch notes
  untracked, no secrets/keys in tree (verified), MIT license.
- [x] v1.0.0 Windows installer built and published as a GitHub release.

### TSX Generator stabilization + parallel jobs (Creator)
**Status: COMPLETE — committed 2026-07-23**

Full plan in `docs/tsx-generator-stability-plan.md`; contributor guide in
`docs/tsx-generator-architecture.md`.

- [x] **Phase 1** — stability foundation: compat-provider abort, agent-sdk
  error-result detection, save/auto-save races, retry-with-backoff,
  string-based validate, `npm run check:types` ratchet gate.
- [x] **Phase 2** — main-process job engine (`src/main/services/tsx-jobs/`):
  up to 4 concurrent generations with isolated `ClaudeSession`s, per-job
  provider + cancel, atomic project naming, queued-job persistence, will-quit
  shutdown.
- [x] **Phase 3** — job-based Creator UI: jobs strip, center-panel ownership
  rule, edits/fixes as jobs.
- [x] **Phase 4** — token streaming, per-project `chat.json` refinement
  history, pipeline tests, `local` + Z.AI providers, **props panel**
  (AST prop extraction + live preview inputProps), custom-provider UI
  (any OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible endpoint), library placeholder rows,
  maxConcurrent setting, coalesced library rescans.
- Z.AI preset verified against docs 2026-07-23: base URL
  `https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic`, model `glm-5.2` (opt: `glm-5.2[1m]`).

### Local AI Models redesign (open-source cleanup)
**Status: COMPLETE (Phases 0–4) — committed; field-verification pending**

Replaced the download-centric SD/Flux catalog (hosted on learnwithhasan.com) with
a ComfyUI-style, folder-as-truth model library built on a category-agnostic core.
Zero owner infrastructure for image models. See
`docs/local-image-models-redesign.md` (design) + `docs/local-image-models-implementation.md`
(plan + full Progress Log).

- [x] **Phase 0** — vitest tooling + type-error baseline (node 36 / web 44).
- [x] **Phase 1** — category-agnostic model-library core (`src/shared/model-library/`,
  `src/main/services/model-library/`): scanner, classifier, sidecars, importer,
  usage-store, category/runtime registries. Electron-free, injectable, 37 tests.
- [x] **Phase 2** — image adapter + registry rework: `SdModelDefinition`→profile
  envelopes (34 entries), `flux`→`flux1`/`flux2`, companion resolution, deleted
  `SD_MODELS_BASE_URL`, generic `MODELS_*` IPC, engine on an injected resolver.
- [x] **Phase 3** — dedicated flag-gated "AI Models" sidebar screen; image library
  view rewritten onto `MODELS_SCAN` (`useImageLibrary` + Header/Installed/Catalog/
  SetupDialog); dashboard Library card; deleted hidden GeneralTab folder block.
- [x] **Phase 4** — deleted audio `MODELS_BASE_URL` + fallback, orphaned
  `useSdImageModels`; fixed the dangling NSIS `build/license.txt` reference
  (→ committed `LICENSE.txt`) so `build:win` completes. 67 tests; node 36 / web 36.

**Pending before this ships (flagged in the Progress Log):**
- Interactive UI click-through of the AI Models screen (not run — non-interactive session).
- Catalog metadata verification: FLUX.2 Klein companion source links + the 13
  link-only `sourceUrl`s are best-effort, not network-verified; verify with a real sd-cli.
- sd-cli binary distribution story (still not bundled).

## Known issues / tech debt

- `scripts/dev.js` wrapper needed to clear `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` env var (VSCode terminal issue)
- `@rollup/rollup-win32-x64-msvc` added to optionalDependencies as workaround for npm bug
- Tailwind CSS native binaries (`lightningcss`, `@tailwindcss/oxide`) require explicit install on Windows

---

## Deviations from plan

- Using `scripts/dev.js` wrapper instead of direct `electron-vite dev` due to VSCode environment variable conflict
