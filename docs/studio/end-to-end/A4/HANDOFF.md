# A4 — Font preflight for exports; GPU proxies default on + the first-4K-import download card
status: NEW

Read `docs/studio/end-to-end/DRIVING.md` with this file (safety rules, launcher, repo facts,
video-14 rules, every "Learned" line — A2 learned that Fast/GPU tools need an app restart after
the in-app full-ffmpeg install).

## Goal (the §3 row verbatim + the exit)

| Part | What | Exit |
|---|---|---|
| **A4** | Font preflight for exports (scan shot copies, warm, refuse when upstream is down); GPU proxies default on when viable + the first-4K-import download card | an export with the upstream blocked after warm-up completes; a fresh 4K import on this PC builds proxies on NVENC without a Settings visit |

Session gates (plan §3 head): `npx vitest run` green, `npm run check:types` at or below
baseline (web 26 / node 10), a live CDP click-through on an isolated profile, the STATUS.md row,
the TESTING.md §18 block (`### 18.4 A4`).

## Step 0 (orchestrator addition, do this FIRST, bounded)

1. **The `shot-generator.test.ts` flake.** It failed in all 3 of the A3 verifier's full runs
   (3 tests from :197 — `isRunning` false, then "This shot is already building" cascading — plus
   `shotDefaults` ENOTEMPTY rmdir and an unhandled rejection from the same file); it passes when
   run alone (and failed 1 in 5 alone once). It fails on `main` too, and the branch does not
   touch `shot-generator.ts` or its test. The session gate can no longer be read while it fails.
   Spend at most ~15 tool calls root-causing it. If it is test isolation (shared temp dir, timers,
   module state, a missing await/cleanup), fix the TEST and prove it with 3 consecutive green full
   runs. If it is a real race in `shot-generator.ts`, do NOT change the product code in A4: record
   the mechanism under Open problems and return to the A4 work. Commit a test-only fix on its own
   (`test(studio): A4 — …`).
2. **Doc over-claim from A3.** `docs/studio/TESTING.md` §18.3 (~:303) cites
   `shot-import.test.ts` for "the import classifier shares the same rule", but that file has no
   `remotion/no-react` / `remotion/version` case. Add the case (accepted; another `remotion/x`
   rejected) so the doc is true.

## Plan context (§1.x facts, §2 decision, §5 items to read)

**§1.7 Fonts (plan :360-364):** proxy cache `<userData>/font-cache`, miss → upstream fetch,
**502 on upstream failure** (`src/main/services/font-proxy.ts:56-87, 173-179` — `fetch(url)` at
:62, `res.status(502)` at :178), registered on both the preview and the export server; brand
fonts are prefetched on brand save (`src/main/services/brand-fonts.ts:68-75`), **shots'
`@remotion/google-fonts` loads are not warmed** — `projects/video-14/notes/import/warm-fonts.mjs`
fills that by hand (Space Grotesk, Inter, JetBrains Mono, Spectral, with `--check`). The URL pass
is `rewriteFontUrls` in `src/main/services/font-proxy-rewrite.ts:33` (re-exported by
`font-proxy.ts:30`, used by `composition-wrapper.ts:281`) — it only sees quoted literals; read
the comment at :46 about what it misses.

**§1.7 Proxies (:357-359):** NVENC measured 60 s of 4K60 HEVC → 540p in **12 s vs 91 s x264**
(`src/main/services/studio/proxy-encoders.ts:7-12`, measured on a GTX 1650 Ti);
`proxyGpuEncoderEnabled` has **no default → off** (`src/main/services/settings.ts:295-300`); one
failure latches x264 for the session. Settings UI row:
`src/renderer/components/SettingsModal/rows/ProxyGpuEncoderRow.tsx` (the optional-download row
pattern, §1.5). Full ffmpeg: BtbN zip, 80.1 MB, SHA pinned, under `<userData>/ffmpeg-full`,
Windows-only (`src/main/services/studio/ffmpeg-full.ts:32-109`).

**§2 T7 (the A4 slice):** "**Fonts never reach the network mid-render**: an export preflight
scans every shot copy's font URLs (the `rewriteFontUrls` pass already finds them), warms the
cache, and refuses to start with a clear message when upstream is unreachable — the proxy's
502-mid-render path goes away. **GPU proxies default on** when an NVIDIA adapter is present and
the full ffmpeg is installed; the first 4K import offers the download with the measured
numbers."

**Orchestrator notes:**
- "Default on" must not override an explicit user choice: an unset setting becomes "on when
  viable"; a user who turned it off stays off. Keep the one-failure x264 latch.
- Making "upstream blocked" testable: same pattern as A2's `VIDTSX_EXPORT_DISK_OVERRIDES` — a
  dev-only override (ignored in packaged builds) that makes the font proxy's upstream fetch fail,
  so the CDP run can (a) warm, then block, then export to completion, and (b) block with a cold
  cache and see the refusal message.
- The download in this part is named by the row ("the first-4K-import download card"): the full
  ffmpeg, 80.1 MB, into A4's isolated profile only. Check C:/D: free space first. After the
  in-app install, a restart may be needed (DRIVING.md "Learned") — if the card's promise
  ("proxies on NVENC without a Settings visit") needs a restart, the card must say so or the code
  must make it unnecessary; record which.
- Material for "a fresh 4K import": the smallest raw DJI clip,
  `D:\repos\claude-youtube-editor\videos\video-14\raw\DJI_20261015115644_0366_D.MP4` (190 MB,
  read-only, referenced in place — import into a scratch project in A4's own scratch root, never
  into the video-14 copy). Confirm it is 3840×2160 with ffprobe first. Proxies land in the scratch
  project's `cache/` — D: had 5.5 GB free at 21:42.
- Material for the font export: the video-14 copy (`.vidtsx-temp/end-to-end/v14-root`, already
  re-bundled in A3). Keep the range short (≈ 3–5 s across a google-fonts shot, e.g. `V14A1Nobody`
  ≈ 0:06–0:11); a 1080p export preset (A1) is fine for the font exit and much cheaper than Full
  4K. Export output into `.vidtsx-temp/end-to-end/A4/`.
- A3 note: `remotion_delayRenderTimeouts` in the render tab is how the A3 verifier saw
  a hold released — useful if you need to prove fonts loaded from the cache during the blocked
  export (the font proxy's own log lines are the simpler evidence: cache hits, zero upstream
  fetches).

## Done (file:line, commit hashes)

## Verified (exact commands + outputs)

(nothing yet)

## Next step (ONE concrete instruction)

Step 0.1: root-cause the `shot-generator.test.ts` flake (≤ ~15 calls) as described above.

## Open problems

(none yet)

## Do-not-redo

- A1, A2, A3 DONE. The video-14 copy's 55 bundles are already fixed — do not re-bundle.
  Do not touch `main`.
